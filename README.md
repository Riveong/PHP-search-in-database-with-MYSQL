Bruteforce really is straight foward and easy to do. ever heard of brute-force attack? basically the attacker submitting many of passwords that they can think or every combination of letters / numbers / symbols. it doesn't need any skills to master it. but the concept is a must to learn. If you can't really think of a solution just use bruteforce. What an absolute loser of me.<br>
